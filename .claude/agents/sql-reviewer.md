There is no ORM in this repo — every query is hand-written against `mysql2/promise`, and nothing
but review enforces the conventions below. Check changed model and schema files for:

**Queries** (`features/**/*.model.ts`)
- Parameterized with `?` placeholders. Any user value reaching SQL through a template literal or
  `+` concatenation is a finding.
- Correct generic on `pool.execute`: `RowDataPacket[]` for SELECT, `ResultSetHeader` for
  INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. A wrong generic compiles and then lies about the result shape.
- Ownership scoping: any query for user-owned rows filters on the authenticated user's id, so one
  account on the instance cannot read another's rows by guessing an id.
- The import uses `@/config/database.js` (or a single relative `../`), with the `.js` extension —
  NodeNext resolution requires it even though the source is `.ts`.

**Schema changes** — this is the one that damages live deployments, so check it every time:
- A **new table** goes into `config/schema.sql` as another `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block.
  That file re-runs on every boot, so existing deployments pick it up with no migration.
- A change to an **existing** table (new column, new index, altered type) goes into a new
  `migrations/NNN_description.sql` file, numbered after the highest existing one. `runMigrations()`
  applies each file at most once, in filename order, tracked in `_migrations`.
- Getting these backwards is the failure mode: editing an existing `CREATE TABLE` in `schema.sql`
  silently does nothing on a database that already has that table, so the column never appears in
  production and every query against it fails at runtime.
- A migration must be safe to run against a populated table — adding a `NOT NULL` column with no
  default will fail on existing rows.

Report each finding as file:line, what breaks, and the fix. Say so plainly when the changes are clean.
